###General description of our program
The purpose of our program is to provide with the most efficient possible schedule based on the combination of people (and their respective skills) and tasks (which have an effort, people, skill and previous task requirement) that a project manager has. The final resuilt is provided as a JFreeChart which provides the manager with visual representation of how to most efficiently organise his personnel and conduct the tasks at hand.

###External API or code used:
